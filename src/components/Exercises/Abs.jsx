However, when pairing ab wheels with deadlifts, it is important to pay attention to the state of your lower back, as both exercises can be quite taxing on the muscles therein and can lead to injury if performed excessively.',

This, in turn, builds impressive strength and muscular endurance, and is arguably safer to perform than more dynamic exercises due to a lack of movement.',
